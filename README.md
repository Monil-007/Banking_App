# Banking_App


---This is a Banking App made by using pure Javascript and offcourse html,css.
---It has three accounts currently with owner's name as follows : Monil Gandhi, Paneri Kothari, Aditi Desai
---To start using this app you need to log in into any one of the account by writing initials of name and surname in lowercase without  space
---For example, for logging into  Monil Gandhi account you need to write 'mg' in user name.
---After that you need to insert pin....(Pins are 1111 for Monil Gandhi, 2222 for Paneri Kothari, 3333 for Aditi Desai...i know pins are weak but its by purpose!!).
---Once you logged in you will see all recent transactions done along with amount date with complete info and even you can sort it by clicking on sort button at bottom.
---At the bottom you can Total money credited and money withdrawal along wiht interest money you gain.
---Also at the right side you have 3 options :

 1) Transfer money to another account (in transfering you need to pass the username with above mentioned rules)(You can even cross-check coz amount you transfer will actually cut from current account and will be added in another account as mentioned )
 
 2)Request a loan from bank(Once you request loan...bank will issue it after some time and you can see all live updates in your account along with new money)
 
 3)Close the account permanently(while closing account you need to confirm by inserting pin once again as it is going to delete account permanently!!)

---Note that the page will be logged out after 5 minutes of Inactivity (since its banking app so security matters) and you need top log in with pin again!!
---The log out timer will start once you log in into the account and you'll see timer decreasing live.
---Also all the dates,time,currency and all are internationalized and hence they will be live and behave as well(Monil account is in India,Paneri account is in US, Aditi account is in UK)
---Overall, a quite well mixture of Javascript and well designed UI will give user a much better experience as a live banking app!!
